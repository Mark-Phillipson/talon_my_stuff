Please create a proposal for the upwork.com job advertised above. Do not include any markdown formatting and mention that I have on the job experience since 2012.

Please also mention that I am based in the UK and I'm available for remote work. I am looking for a long-term engagement and I am currently available. 

note that I wish to end the proposal with "Best regards, Mark P." 

Please start the proposal with "Dear Prospective Client."

Also mention that I have high-speed broadband.

If helpful and relevant to the project, please mention that I can integrate AI features such as Smart Paste, textarea suggestions, and semantic search into your application.

For best results, I prefer a detailed application specification so I can accurately meet your requirements; if a full specification isn't available I'm happy to work with you to clarify details, though this may affect the project's timeline and budget.

Please mention that I hold a GitHub Copilot Pro subscription (with Agentic Workflows), which helps accelerate development—particularly for repetitive code patterns, onboarding new libraries, and improving consistency—potentially reducing delivery time and effort.

Below is my Upwork profile, please use this to figure out what skills to mention on the proposal:
