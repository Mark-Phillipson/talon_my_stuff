The gliding cursor is quite a useful thing for people with accessibility ♿️. It would be great if we had commands for vertical fast (↕️🐇), vertical slow (↕️🐢), horizontal fast (↔️🐇) and horizontal slow (↔️🐢). What do you think? 🤔

Bolting information 🔧: Implement as four Talon commands (suggested IDs: `user.glide_vertical_fast`, `user.glide_vertical_slow`, `user.glide_horizontal_fast`, `user.glide_horizontal_slow`) that accept an optional repeat count or duration parameter. Use relative motion with adjustable speed multipliers (fast ≈ ×2.0, slow ≈ ×0.5) so the behavior is predictable across apps and display scalings. Recommend short spoken captures and optional keyboard bindings (for example Ctrl+Alt+Arrow keys) for power users. Accessibility notes: ensure the movement respects focus, doesn't interfere with assistive tools, and provides a way to stop immediately; include unit/integration tests and a small demo script to verify behavior across common apps and DPI settings. ✅
