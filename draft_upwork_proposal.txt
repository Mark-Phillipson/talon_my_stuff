Dear Prospective Client.

I am writing to express my interest in your .NET Framework project. I have on the job experience since 2012 and am based in the UK, available for remote work. I am seeking a long-term engagement and am currently available to start immediately.

With a proven track record of 100% Job Success and Top Rated Plus status on Upwork, I bring extensive experience in developing data-centric desktop and web applications using Microsoft technologies. My skillset includes C#, ASP.NET (MVC, Web API, Core), Blazor (WASM, Server, Hybrid), Microsoft SQL Server/T-SQL, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSON, and XML. I am also proficient in Azure DevOps, Azure SQL, Azure Storage, Git, and GitHub.

I have a strong background in GUI/UX design with MVC and Blazor, and am experienced in migrating data from various sources into relational data models. I can also integrate advanced AI functionality such as Smart Paste, textarea suggestions, and semantic search into your application to enhance productivity and user experience.

I have high-speed broadband to ensure reliable remote collaboration. Additionally, I hold a valid subscription to GitHub Copilot, which will significantly speed up the development process, especially when working with repetitive or boilerplate code.

To ensure the project is completed on time and within budget, I will require a detailed application specification. If this information is not provided, it may make the project more difficult to complete efficiently.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and deliver a high-quality solution tailored to your needs.

Best regards, Mark P.
