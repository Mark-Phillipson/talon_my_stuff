Dear Prospective Client.

I am an experienced Full Stack Developer based in the UK, specializing in ASP.NET MVC, Blazor (WASM/Server/Hybrid), and Microsoft SQL Server. I have on the job experience since 2012 and have been developing data-centric desktop and web applications using Microsoft technologies since 1999. My expertise includes GUI/UX design with MVC and Blazor, and I am highly proficient in C#, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap 5, CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, JSON, and Progressive Web Apps.

I am available for remote work and am looking for a long-term engagement. I currently have high-speed broadband and a static IP, ensuring reliable connectivity for collaboration and support during US hours as required. I am also comfortable quoting project costs and adhering to agreed budgets and timelines.

In addition to my core skills, I can integrate advanced AI functionality into your application, such as Smart Paste, textarea suggestions, and semantic search, to enhance user experience and productivity. I am also familiar with tools like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Git, Azure DevOps, Azure SQL, Azure Storage, VBA, and Visual Basic.NET.

To ensure the successful and timely delivery of your project, I will require a detailed application specification. Without this, it may be challenging to meet your requirements within the desired timeframe and budget.

I hold a valid subscription to GitHub Copilot, which will significantly speed up the development process, especially for repetitive coding tasks.

I am currently available and eager to discuss your project in more detail.

Best regards, Mark P.
