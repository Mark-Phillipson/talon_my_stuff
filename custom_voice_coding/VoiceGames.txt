Hello EVERYONE,

I am a microphone only user due to repetitive strain injuries in my hands back and shoulders.

I have worked out how to play some games by voice using Talon Voice. For Example Sudden Strike 4, Company of Heroes 2.  These games allow you to issue commands while the game is paused and have them executed once you take it off pause.

Other than general turn based games can you recommend some games that a non keyboard or non mouse user could play after adding some voice command in the place of keyword shortcuts?
