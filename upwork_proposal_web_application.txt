Dear Prospective Client,

I am writing to express my strong interest in your web application development project. With over 12 years of on-the-job experience since 2012, I am well-positioned to take over your existing web application and deliver the quality results you require.

My expertise directly aligns with your technical requirements. I have extensive experience with Microsoft Visual Studio, MS SQL Server, C#, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. As a full-stack developer specializing in ASP.NET MVC/Blazor and Microsoft SQL Server, I have been developing data-centric desktop and web applications using Microsoft technologies since 1999.

My relevant technical skills include:
- C# and ASP.NET Web API/MVC development
- Microsoft SQL Server and T-SQL database management
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- Modern front-end technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA) development
- Blazor WASM/Client, Server, and Hybrid applications
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Cloud technologies including Azure SQL and Azure Storage

I am based in the UK and available for remote work with high-speed broadband connectivity, ensuring reliable communication and file transfers throughout the project. I am seeking a long-term engagement and am currently available to start immediately.

To enhance your application's capabilities, I can integrate cutting-edge AI functionality including Smart Paste features, textarea suggestions, and semantic search functionality. These modern enhancements can significantly improve user experience and application efficiency.

I maintain a valid subscription to GitHub Copilot, which considerably accelerates the development process, particularly when working with repetitive or recurring code patterns. This tool helps ensure faster delivery times while maintaining code quality.

Regarding project management, I will require a detailed application specification to ensure I can meet your specific needs effectively. Without comprehensive documentation, projects can become more challenging to complete on time and within budget. I believe clear requirements are essential for successful project delivery.

I am comfortable working weekends when project deadlines require it and can commit 10-40 hours per week based on project demands. My Upwork profile shows 100% job success rate and Top Rated Plus status, demonstrating my commitment to client satisfaction and project excellence.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss your project requirements in detail and demonstrate how my experience can benefit your web application development goals.

Best regards,
Mark P.
